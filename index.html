It gives you nothing back, no manuscripts to store away, no paintings to show on walls and maybe hang in museums, no poems to be printed and sold, nothing but that single fleeting moment when you feel alive."</blockquote><p>Great dance photography is a way to give back to the dancer. A fleeting moment that they themselves never see, only feel, captured in an image. The response from a dancer to an image that captures something of what they feel, what they imagine themselves to be, is pure gratitude!</p>

			<p>The tips below will get you started, but there is much trial and error and perseverence before being rewarded with an image that is elevated from mere documentation to that of art.</p>

				<p>It can be a bit intimidating to turn the camera from AUTO mode to MANUAL mode, but if you want crisp, clean shots, you've got to do it! Here are some of the basic settings to get you started. You may have to search for your particular camera model to find out where these settings are located.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Picture quality</b> - <a href="http://photographyconcentrate.com/10-reasons-why-you-should-be-shooting-raw/">Shoot in RAW </a>format, unless you are short on space, but really in that case, get a bigger SD card. RAW gives you the flexibility to adjust exposure which means you can take a dark shot but still have a high enough shutter speed and end up with a decent image. It also gives you the most flexibility for cropping.</li>
					<li><b><a href="https://photographylife.com/what-is-shutter-speed-in-photography">Shutter speed</a></b> - Absolute minimum of 1/320 to prevent blur in most dance, minimum 1/500 for professional level dancer or a high energy move like a jump or spin.</li>
					<li><b>Aperture</b> - When shooting an individual dancer F4 is usually fine, and when indoors maybe necessary to get enough light. Ensemble shots where you would like everyone in focus will require a higher aperture, experiment based on conditions. Apertures less than F4 may render part of the dancer's body out of focus, this can be acceptable if that s is the image you trying for.</li>
					<li><b>ISO</b> - This controls the sensitivity of the camera sensor. Always use the lowest possible setting without sacrificing shutter speed. For indoor dance events I try to keep it at 3200 or below, there is just too much grain in the photo above that 3200 threshold.</li>
					<li><b>Shutter speed, aperture and ISO</b> together control your exposure, depth of field and grain. Understanding the <a href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-exposure.htm">exposure triangle</a> is crucial when in manual mode.
					<li><b><a href="http://www.digital-photo-secrets.com/tip/3798/shooting-burst-mode/">Burst mode </a></b>- This allows a succession of shots at a high rate while the shutter button is depressed. Because dancers movements are hard to catch at the exact right time, a series of burst shots increases your chance of getting the top of the jump, or the exact moment one dancer interacts with another.</li>
					<li><b>Use auto focus and <a href="http://improvephotography.com/4552/back-button-focusing/">back-button focus</a></b> - You really aren't going to try to manually focus while dancers are moving all over the place are you? More information on back button focus here.</li>

				<p>Although a lot can be corrected with a good crop when editing, it is very much preferred to get the <a href="http://photographyconcentrate.com/10-reasons-why-you-need-to-learn-composition/">composition</a> you want "in camera". If the dances are set dances that are done almost the same way everytime you can learn to anticipate good shots by learning the dances! Many folk dance groups have a set repretroire and if you see them perform enough times you will have an advantage. If you are trying to capture modern, ballet and tap dance as part of a recital, ask to attend dress rehearsals. In fact, many directors would prefer photographers take pictures during the dress rehearsal as you will not be interferring with the audience. Another technique is to anticipate when a dancer will do a spin or a jump. If you look with the intent to learn this you will begin to see subtle body changes that will tip you off when there is a big move coming!</p><p>Simple things that can be neglected in the excitement of a performance should not be! Pay attention to keeping your camera level. Hold your camera steady to avoid blur from shaking. Take a second to decide what you want to focus on before firing off 10 shots. Finally, although most of the action is on stage, do not forget about opportunities that exist off stage, interactions between dancers, directors and dancers, or just a lone dancer warming up can be very effective images that capture a different side of dance. Look at the artist <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/edgar-degas-moma_us_56f2f321e4b0c3ef5217b69a">Degas</a> in particular for some inspiration for "behind the scenes" composition. <a href="http://petapixel.com/2016/02/16/photos-dancer-misty-copeland-recreating-famous-degas-paintings/">This article</a> shows an interesting work of photography with Misty Copeland recreating some of Degas paintings with photographs.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html">Lightroom</a> or another photo editor is essential for bringing the most out of your image. You may have friends who brag on Instagram that they didn't use a filter (#nofilter). As if the raw image, right of the camera, is somehow superior. It is not. Use whatever means necessary to bring your image to the result you wish whether that be a more artistic or a strikingly realistic interpretation. Part of the brilliance of dance can be the colors of the costumes; saturate those colors, darken your darks and lighten your lights. Contrast or lack of it communicates something, make sure it looks the way you want to see it.</p><p>Lightroom is also where one adjusts for exposure and light temperture. Remember when I said you can take a dark photo and rescue it if you shoot in RAW, Lightroom is your lifesaver. You can make a change of several stops of light in the editing room without sacrificing quality of the image. Does your image have a yellow or blue cast, the temperature can also be fixed in Lightroom and to much greater satisfaction if you are working with RAW files. If you aren't able to get the color cast that looks natural, try for a monochrome filter or a simple black and white.</p><p>Don't forget to use crop and straighten to alter your image as well. Crop an image following the <a href="http://www.ultimate-photo-tips.com/photography-rule-of-thirds.html">rule of thirds</a> to bring greater focus on one aspect of the image. And by all means if you weren't holding your camera level, correct it before publishing it anywhere!</p>
